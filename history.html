			<h2>The History of Monitoring</h2>
		<p>Humans must have observed birds from the earliest times stone age drawings are among the oldest indications of an interest in birds. Birds were perhaps important as a food source, and bones of as many as 80 species have been found in excavations of early Stone Age settlements. 
        </p>
        <p>Cultures around the world have rich vocabularies related to birds.  The traditional bird names are often based on knowledge of their behavior and with many names being of onomatopoeic nature and many are still in use today but traditional knowledge and knowledge of these practices is passed on through oral traditions today. The Hunting of wild birds as well as their domestication would have required considerable knowledge of their habits. Poultry farming and falconry were practiced from early times in many parts of the world. When in turns bring you to modern time in monitoring migratory birds to help keep track of there patterns and also give us a good idea of the amount of birds that are out there and give use the opportunity to help improve the ecosystem’s out there and to help them for future generations to enjoy as we do.</p>

   			<h3>The History of Falconry</h3>
       
       <p>  The history of falconry has been dated back and began in the Mesopotamia time dating back to 2000 BC there was also some evidence of raptor in the northern altal, western Mongolia. The falcon was a symbolic bird of ancient Mongolia tribes. There is some disagreement about early accounts of such early practices of falconry. Falconry was possibly induced to Europe around 400 AD, when the Huns and Alans invaded from the east. The most prominent falconer know in Europe is Frederick II of Hohenstaufen (1194-1250). He is believed to have received first hand knowledge of Arabic falconry during the wars in the region (between 1228 and 1229) by obtaining a copy of Moamyn’s the manual of falconry and translated it in to Latin to “De arte venanbi cum avibus or known by the English as (“The art of hunting with birds”) Witch is thee book for a falconer to read if you ever get involved in to any kind of falconry activity.

	<p>Historically, Falconry was a popular sport and the status symbol among Nobles of medieval Europe.  In order to be involved with the world of falconry it requires a lot of time, a good amount of money and a lot of space and most commoners of the medieval times could not afford it. In today would it still dose cost money time and space but it also requires you to obtain permits to have a falcon and also a license to hunt and if you are just starting out it a 7 year processes. The first 2 year you are consider a apprentices and you need to have a master falconer to show you the rope and also need to do a lot of reading and take a test to get you apprentice permit and are restricted to only being able to have one of two type of falcons which being a red tail hawk or a American kestrel. At the third you are able to continue on with you studies as a falconer on you own and allowed to have two birds of any breed except for eagles and that is where most falconers stop and enjoy the sport. The ultimate goal is of coarse is the seven year mark which is a master falconer and you are able to have 3 birds and even a eagle with a special state and federal permit plus you get the pleasure of keeping the sport alive by taking on apprentices.
